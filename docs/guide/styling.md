# Styling and CSS

> Jcrop uses a tight mixture of HTML and CSS to present its user interface.
> This document contains information about modifying the default
> styling to accomodate your UI/UX needs.

## Structural Overview

## Useful classes

Several classes can be applied to the container (or parent elements) to
perform some visual tweaks.

### `jcrop-ux-inactive-handles`

**Display handles on inactive crop widgets.**
The behavior without this class is that handles will be hidden on crop
widgets that are not the currently active widget.

## SASS template

Jcrop CSS files are compiled using SASS definitions found in the file
`build/css/jcrop.css`. It is recommended that you review this file
before making CSS changes, as it is well-commented and understanding
how the Jcrop CSS is generated by SASS can be helpful even if you are
not using SASS to make your changes.
